Exercises of algorithms and data structure using Python. From the simplest to the most advanced.

> Before there were computers, there were algorithms.

An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as INPUT, and produces some value, or set of values as OUTPUT. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into a output.
